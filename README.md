This is a markdown report which analyses a fictional dataset created by Dr. Carla Patalano and Dr Rich Huebner of the New England College of Business. 
It is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set

Dr Huebner poses some potential areas of interest within the dataset, some of which I have looked at as well as analysing some areas of my own interest.
